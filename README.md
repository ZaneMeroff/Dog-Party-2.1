# Dog Party 2.0
This was my first project at Turing. I started the project on 09/30/19 and finished it on 10/04/19, spending about 8 to 10 hours building it. This was my first time writing JavaScript. I had a lot of fun creating this project. I did not quite finish all the requirements, because I was unable to figure out how to accomplish some things in JavaScript. After this project is turned in, I plan to learn how to write the functions I am missing.

### Project Summary
The project requirements were to first build the HTML and CSS to make the page look like the provided comp (see below images), then to write JavaScript that would auto-populate the h1 heading with the user provided name. Then to add functional buttons near the bottom that would make the text disappear/reappear. Then add tooltips to the nav menu. Finally, create a new text field where user input would replace text in one of the three "dog lingo" columns.

##### Iteration 0: Build and Style Site

* Start by building the HTML and using semantic tags to create a clean structure for your page. Work to craft your HTML according to the Turing HTML Style Guide

* Style your site using CSS – aim to get it as visually close to the comp as possible. Work to craft your CSS according to the Turing CSS Style Guide

* Create a README.md file that gives a brief overview of your project (don’t forget to make sure to include the comps as well as the screen grabs of your finished site!). This is great resource for markdown!

##### Iteration 1: Add some functionality

* Once you have the HTML structure built and successfully being styled to work for both layouts using your two CSS files, experiment with adding in interaction using JavaScript: Build functionality to allow a user to type a dog name in the input field and then, when the user clicks the button, have that dog name replace the text Some Dogs in the main A Site About Some Dogs header and clear out the input field. For example: if I typed Fido into the input, when I click the button the main header of the page should change to read A Site About Fido.

* Work to craft your JavaScript according to the Turing JavaScript Style Guide

##### Iteration 2: Make it responsive

* Make your Dog Party site mobile. We haven’t given you layouts for mobile, so think about how you’ll approach making each layout work best for small screens. Do side-by-side columns on large screens stack when viewed on a phone? What about larger sections of content? Experiment using your DevTools and media queries! Note - we realize we have not explicitly covered any of this in class; this is a great chance to push yourself and do some independent learning!

##### Iteration 3: Extensions

* Add functionality to each of the buttons in each column. When the user clicks on the button, it should hide the content in that specific column (still having the picture and button be displayed). When the user clicks the button again, the text should display once more.
Bonus: add a nice animation to this to give a better transition

* Add a tooltip to each of the elements in the navigation bar. When a user hovers over one of them, a tool tip should appear giving more information as to what that page is about.

* Add another input and text area to the form that can update the text in each column. The input should either be a dropdown or radio/checkboxes to specify which column’s text is being updated.
